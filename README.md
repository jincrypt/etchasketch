## Tasks:
- Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs (using Javascript)
- Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them
- Add a button which will clear the current grid and send the user a popup asking for new grid dimensions
- Once entered the new grid should be generated in the same total space as before
- (Optional): Instead of just changing the color of your grid from black to white (for example) have each pass through it with the mouse change to a completely random RGB value. Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it so that only after 10 passes is the square completely black.

- (Personal Goals): Add option to change drawing mode from 'hover' to 'mouse click-and-drag'    [Done!]
- (Personal Goals): Make this touchscreen compatible (touch and drag)                           [Done!]
- (Personal Goals): Make page responsive (looks OK in all screen sizes)                         [Done!]
